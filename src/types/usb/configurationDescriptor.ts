	 * #### Notes
	 * A device configuration reports whether the configuration is bus-powered or self-powered.
	 * Device status reports whether the device is currently self-powered. If a device is
	 * disconnected from its external power source, it updates device status to indicate that
	 * it is no longer self-powered.
	 *
	 * A device may not increase its power draw from the bus, when it loses its external power
	 * source, beyond the amount reported by its configuration.
	 *
	 * If a device can continue to operate when disconnected from its external power source, it
	 * continues to do so. If the device cannot continue to operate, it fails operations it can
	 * no longer support. The USB System Software may determine the cause of the failure by
	 * checking the status and noting the loss of the deviceâ€™s power source.
